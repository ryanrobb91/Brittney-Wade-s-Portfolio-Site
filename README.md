# Brittney-Wade-s-Portfolio-Site

 Switched to doing this at the last minute so its not pretty but I think it meets all the requirements.
 Site made to display pictures, link to social media and subscribe for photoshoot bookings.
 
## For css I have a menu button that expands vertically and changes places from desktop to mobile. I used flexbox as well.


## For javascript I have a message pop up saying thank you for subscribing "your name".



## 4 media queries
480px

site not finished but hopefully finished enough
